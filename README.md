# WebApp-Project
This repository is about an application to make predictions on Trained Logistic Regression Model of Titanic Dataset.

##  ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Streamlit App
### ðŸ“Œ Overview
    This Streamlit Web App allows users to:
    âœ… Upload the Titanic dataset (CSV format)
    âœ… Perform data preprocessing and train a Logistic Regression model
    âœ… View key model performance metrics
    âœ… Visualize dataset insights with interactive plots
    âœ… Predict whether a passenger would survive based on user input

### ðŸŽ¯ Features
    ðŸ”¹ Upload Titanic Dataset: Accepts only the Titanic dataset and verifies its columns.
    ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.
    ðŸ”¹ Train Logistic Regression Model: Automatically trains the model after preprocessing.
    ðŸ”¹ Performance Metrics (Optional): Displays accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
    ðŸ”¹ Visualizations (Optional):
     * Confusion Matrix
     * ROC Curve
     * Dataset insights (Passenger Class, Gender Distribution, Survival Rate by Class & Gender)
         ðŸ”¹ User Input Prediction: Allows users to input passenger details and predict survival.

### ðŸ“Š Visualizations
    The app provides interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn with enhanced color themes:
    âœ… Confusion Matrix â€“ Heatmap to analyze classification results
    âœ… ROC Curve â€“ Visualizing the trade-off between true positive rate & false positive rate
    âœ… Survival Rate Charts â€“ Bar charts for Passenger Class, Gender Distribution, and Class-Gender Survival Rate

### ðŸš€ Deployment
    This app can be deployed on Streamlit Cloud or any hosting platform that supports Streamlit apps.

### âœ¨ Future Improvements
    ðŸš€ Add more ML models for comparison
    ðŸš€ Implement feature selection & hyperparameter tuning
    ðŸš€ Enhance UI with Streamlit components
